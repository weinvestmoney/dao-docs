# Manifesto

WeInvest Manifesto - the first trading platform for crypto and stocks, owned by the people.

Robinhood and Coinbase IPOed for billions of dollars. People got rich, and it wasnâ€™t the people that bought the stock when it came onto public markets.

The rich people bought the stock before it was available to the general public. They had privelege. They were sitting in some cush spot, bought the stock for pennies on the dollar, and sold it to all the lamos that bought the stock when it came onto public markets.

WeInvest is community-owned. There will never be any insider that bought in before anybody else. The members of the community can buy the token on an exchange, and can earn tokens by contributing back to the community.
