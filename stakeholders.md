# Stakeholders

The WeInvest community makes up a large portion of the stakeholders. Other stakes are reserved for investors, developers, marketers, and operators.

### What is WIT?

WeInvest is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which means decisions that guide the platform are made by community stakeholders. Community members who hold WIT are co-owners and voting members of the WeInvest DAO. Think of a DAO as an online co-operative.\
\
All WeInvest revenue is funneled back into the DAO Community Treasury which enables the mission of decentralized mixed asset trading platforms.\
\
Advanced cryptocurrency users can earn token yield and participate in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by providing WIT liquidity to token pools. For DeFi newcomers: think of this as providing a deposit of WIT to earn a return.

### Get WIT

You can earn WIT as a reward for contributing to the community. Just send messages on our Discord server, in our Discourse forum, or in our Github repositories, to start earning WIT. Official announcements will come soon. Please be aware of scams and fake listings prior to the official launch of WIT!
