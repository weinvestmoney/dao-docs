# Conclusion

The WeInvest DAO was conceived in mid 2021 after the IPOs of Coinbase and Robinhood. Millions of dollars are generated everyday, in the form of trading fees. In some cases these trading fees are waived, when the organization can generate revenue in other ways, such as PFOF (payment for order flow) and interest on cash balances. These fees are used to pay employees inflated salaries, and stuff the pockets of the board members and shareholders. The early investors are the ones who made the most. By the time the shares reach the public markets, the gains have already been had. The investors have already made 1000x or more, then the dump it onto the public markets for the average person to buy.

We went from paying $60 to trade stocks, to paying $10 for trades, to paying $0 for trades. Next, we will be paid to trade. This is the WeInvest Manifesto.\
